MedWell Project: Fixes, Suggestions & Integration Guide
This document outlines the fixes applied to your project and provides a step-by-step guide to integrate the new advanced features.

1. Summary of Fixes
I have corrected several issues in your existing pages to improve functionality and data accuracy.

Pathing Errors: The primary error was incorrect casing in import paths (e.g., ../Components/... instead of ../components/...). I have corrected these paths in Analytics.jsx and Dashboard.jsx.

Data Fetching: The Analytics.jsx page has been updated to fetch data from your API layer (medicineApi) instead of the old mock database file, making it consistent with the rest of the application.

SchedulesPage.jsx: The form for adding and editing schedules has been fully implemented with complete state management. I also replaced the basic window.confirm() with a much-improved custom modal for deleting schedules.

HistoryPage.jsx: The page has been enhanced to group your dose logs by date, making the history much cleaner and easier to read.

DashboardPage.jsx: This page now correctly integrates the new services for AI-powered adherence predictions and scheduling browser notifications.

2. Integration Steps
To get the new features working, please follow the setup guide from my previous message. Here is a summary:

Create the backend folder at the root of your project and place the server.js and package.json files inside it.

Create the src/services folder and place the googleCalendarApi.js, notificationService.js, and predictionService.js files inside.

Update your API files (src/api/medicineApi.js and src/api/otherApi.js) to use axios and point to http://localhost:5000/api, as detailed in the previous message.

Run the Backend Server:

Open a new terminal.

Navigate to the backend folder (cd backend).

Install dependencies (npm install).

Start the server (npm start). Keep this terminal running.

Set up Google Calendar:

Follow the instructions to get your Google API Key and OAuth Client ID.

Paste these credentials into src/services/googleCalendarApi.js.

Add the connect/disconnect buttons to your src/pages/Settings.jsx file.

3. What to Do Next
Your project is now in a very strong position. The frontend is robust, and you have a clear path for integrating advanced features.

Thoroughly Test: With the mock backend running, go through every page of your application. Create, edit, and delete schedules. Log doses (both taken and skipped). Verify that the dashboard, history, and analytics pages all update correctly.

Refine the AI Prediction Logic: The predictionService.js file contains a basic set of rules. You can make this much more powerful by adding more conditions. For example:

Check for missed doses on specific days of the week (e.g., "You tend to miss doses on weekends.").

Check for patterns with specific medications.

Lower the data threshold (if (doseLogs.length < 10)) for testing purposes.

Build the Real Backend: The mock backend is great for development, but for a real application, you will need to build a persistent backend using a technology like Node.js with Express and a database like MongoDB or PostgreSQL. Your frontend API calls are already set up, so you would just need to change the API_URL and ensure your real backend has the same endpoints.

Enhance Notifications: The current notification service is basic. For a production app, you should implement a Service Worker. This is a script that runs in the background and can deliver push notifications even when the user's browser tab is closed, which is essential for a reminder app.

You have built an excellent foundation. By following these steps, you can complete the advanced features and create a truly impressive application.
